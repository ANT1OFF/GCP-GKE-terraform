# Terraform templates for automatic deployment of applications to Google Cloud Platforms' Kubernetes engine

This repository is part of a bachelor thesis done by four students from NTNU Gj√∏vik. As the title states, the problem at hand is to automate deployment of complex applications to GCPs' Kubernetes Engine.

Currently this repo is for testing purposes only as we try to figure out which technologies to use for solving our thesis' main issue. In this repo we try to deploy using Hashicorps' Terraform.
